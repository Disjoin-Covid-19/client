# Disjoin Front End

The user interface of the Disjoin web application, designed for mobile use

## Getting Started

Download the my-app folder or clone the [repo](https://github.com/Disjoin-Covid-19/frontend)

### Prerequisites

Node.js and npm (follow this [link](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) for instructions)

```
npm install
```

### Running the App

1. Set up the local server of mockup data:

```
cd my-app/server 
node expressjson.js 
```

2. Run the app (I would recommend using the "inspect element" tool on your browser to view the mobile interface of the app, check [here](https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-simulate-mobile-devices-with-device-mode-in-chrome/) for help):

```
cd my-app
npm start
```
