One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Running the App

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

1. Set up the local server of mockup data:

```
cd my-app/server 
node expressjson.js 
```

2. Run the app (I would recommend using the "inspect element" tool on your browser to view the mobile interface of the app, check link for help https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-simulate-mobile-devices-with-device-mode-in-chrome/):

```
cd my-app
npm start
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
